MARMOUSI DATA FILES - IEEE BIG ENDIAN FORMAT

The three files in this directory are

velocity.segy = Marmousi velocity model
density.segy  = Marmousi density model
data.segy     = Marmousi synthetic data

All three are SEGY disk images, but converted to IEEE big endian
format.

Many utilities can read these files or convert them to other
formats. Probably the easiest to access is the Seismic Unix segyread
command. [To obtain Seismic Unix, visit www.cwp.mines.edu/cwpcodes.]

To read these files into SU format, 

* on a big endian platform (Solaris or Linux on UltraSparc, 
Mac OS-X on PowerPC)

  segyread tape=xxx.segy conv=0 endian=1 > xxx.su

* on a little endian platform (Linux on Intel/AMD, DEC Alpha)  

  segyread tape=xxx.segy conv=0 endian=0 > xxx.su

where xxx = velocity, density, or data.

To obtain a flat binary file of data samples (minus the SEGY headers
included in the SU data format) us sustrip:

  sustrip < xxx.su > xxx.bin

The velocity and density files have nx = 2301, nz = 751 samples, with
x being the fast dimension, ie. the data are stored by depth row.

The data consists of 23040 traces of 750 samples each, with the time
axis being fastest.

[William W. Symes constructed these files using an ad hoc utility to
read the original IFP tapes and convert the data on the fly to IEEE
format, in Fall 1990.]
